# Generated Tokens

This file is not imported into the project. It's used entirely for intellisense and autocomplete of tailwind generated css variables.

## The problem

Cube CSS uses Tailwind to generate utility classes but does not allow for easy access in VSCode to the css variables.

Some extensions [such as this one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vunguyentuan.vscode-css-variables) allow autocomplete for css vars. This works well with variables defined in the `assets/css` directory but it does not pickup those generated by tailwind.

For example in `assets/css` there exists `--gutter` as

```css
--gutter: var(--space-s-l);
```

But `--space-s-l` is generated by the Cube CSS tailwind implementation.

## The solution

In order to have these utility classes available for autocomplete the `packages/cube/tailwind.config.js` has an additional code block that exports all css variables to `cube/generated/tokens.css`.

> Important: this file is only generated when process.env.NUXT_VITE_NODE_OPTIONS is true. Which should prevent the tailwind css vscode extension from generating the tokens. If vscode autocomplete is broken, check the tailwind vscode extension logs as it may be trying to export the tokens.css file (which will fail).

This `tokens.css` file will be picked up by the autocomplete extension and `--space-s-l` will get intellisense support
